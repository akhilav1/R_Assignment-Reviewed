# R_Assignment-Reviewed

This is the git hub repository I created for the review https://github.com/akhilav1/BCB546X-Fall2019. After my peer reviewers comments I changed the code slightly and organized it more properly. The 40 files and graphs are in the "File" folder. This is the raw form. I just want to let you know if you got confused looking at the commit history.
